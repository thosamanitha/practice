I am feeling grateful for being a part in iB Hubs. I really thankful to iB Hubs for giving me this wonderful chance.

Behavioral Aspects:

1. Before coming to the iB Hubs, i don't  interact with the people even though they are known to me or else even though they are my classmates. I am having that much of resistance to speak with the people. But after coming to the iB Hubs at first i felt some difficulty to talk with new people, but now i can easily mingle with anyone. This is the best thing that i learnt and improved.                                                                                                                               
2. Whenever i get any doubt i never asked my faculty because i feel nervous to talk with higher people when i was in my college, and i have spent more time on that to learn than the time its actually needed. But now i am able to ask doubts and discuss without any fear or resistance.
3. i have developed a growth mindset, this is the biggest achievement that i achieved here.
4. I have developed a mindset which can think in number of ways for a single problem.
5. I have learnt taking care of our friends and our family also by the guidlines given by iBhubs. Example: while saying some guidlines or the things that we need to follow in corona pandemic situation, sir included the people as well as their families. That thing makes me very happy. i came to decide that i need to take care of people like sir in future.
6. Learning hours:  before coming to iBhubs i don't know about learning hours even i didn't heard that word. But whenever we came here initially i thought that how these learning hours can change us. They are not human beings like us, then how can they improve us, like that i felt in the initial stage. But one day after deepthi akka session, i was thinking about learning hours and i questioned myself, if there is a problem then we will came with a solution in learning hours and we will implement it, if it is not solving the problem then we will ask others to suggest. so i came to know that any type of problem can be solved and improved a lot. continuos learning hours in class and rooms improved me a lot in both technical aspect and behavioral aspect.

Technical Aspect:

1. i am waiting to express my gratitude to the iBHubs by writing these lines. Because iB Hubs makes me to know about myself. I have learnt coding in  a depth which can make me to do a problem on my own. before coming here i know the concepts but really don't know the implementation. And this iB Hubs makes to feel happy by doing the problems and getting the correct output, i felt like i am something and i can do something.
2. I have learnt nearly 3 thousand to 4 thousands of vocabulary words which helps me a lot while interacting with the people.
3. While solving a problem, initial i am not able to debug the code and i am struggling a lot even in breaks also how to write the code or how to debug the code. but after doing the continuos assignments regarding the computer languages like c and python. i really happy to say that i am able to debug the code.  
4. while practicing something or learning something we are learning in a depth manner which makes us to get more and more clarity.
5. after learning something in every session regarding a topic, here  we are doing hands on and getting more clarity. for this we are very happy.
6. while i was in my college i am having fear of exams, but after coming to iB Hubs because of continuous exams and assignments, i am feeling free and i left that fear.
7. I am a type of person with lots of rigidity in any aspect. But After sir session i left that feeling. because of that i am feeling very free now. 
8. A wonderful moment that i felt me and my family as well as my villagers given by iB Hubs is attending to the "THE THINGS CONFERENCE". This is the first experience to me and my family also felt very very happy for that. In that conference i met a man who is the  Founder of a company and he is very nice person and we have interacted nearly 40 minutes which makes me very happy. That is the first experience to me with the foreigners.
9. while i was in our college i have wasted much time while doing the things. but now i am following the time frames and using my time efficiently.
10. i have learnt html and css in a good manner and i have build my own website. I gave that URL to my friends,family and relatives. That moment they praised me a lot. This experience is also because of iBHubs only.
11. while we are in college we used to sleep at late nights and we slept in the class sometimes, But now as we are maintaining a time for everything all the things are going in a good way. And we are also concentrating in class. We have improved the habit of doing the things in a correct way.
12. i have improved my speaking skills, by explaining to my teammates if they ask me to explain a topic.The way i am explaining improved a lot day by day.
13.  Because of sir session i am constantly getting encouragement. If we done something the sir will praise us in the meeting hall. That moment gives us more energy to do more and more.
14. After coming to iBHubs i learned to live independently, which is very important in every persons life.
15. By the culture of iBHubs i have developed my positive thinking which gives us positive energy.
16. The concept of visualization developed by iBHubs makes me to improve in a very broad manner. While visualising something in a positive way i loved to enjoy that feeling. That makes me to do or to complete so many things.
17. Before coming to iBHubs i have a dream to develope an Application on my own which helps to the people. But it just a dream but i didn't place any special efforts on that. But after coming here i am atleast trying to do something with these concepts that i have learnt so far in iBhubs. And i came to know that and i believe that i can build my app definitely with the Help of iBhubs.

Case Study 1: While coming to the iB Hubs for doing Long Term Internship

Disappointment: While coming to the iB Hubs my friends and my faculty told me or suggested me that not to go for internship. At that time, i really faced Full confusion and i am thinking whole night whether to go or not. Because of that i was totally disappointed for 2 days. This disappointment is because of fear.

Emotions: i got emotionally disturbed, while coming here by leaving my friends and college. All of my friends giving send off to us with full of tears in their eyes.That emotion continued in me for first 1 week after coming here.

Intensity: suddenly, we got selected list and offer letters and we should leave the campus in 2 days after giving the selected list and offer letters. At that time that is my first own decision that i have chose in my life on my own, I don't know about internships because we just entered into 3 rd year, until we came here we don't have the experience and i am feeling fear by thinking that how can i survive there without knowing about my internship. The intensity of that fear and emotion is exponentially high.

Internal Filter: The internal filter that came into my thoughts is, this is the first time where our college is going to provide 2 years long internship and in these 2 years i can definitely develop my skills as i am going to a company which is already proved that iB Hubs can makes the things to be possible. director sir is suggesting us to go for internship and i believe Kavya Akka the most, and also i love the culture of the iBHubs and the freedom that they gave to us, to share everything make us to come here.

External Amplifier:
But most of my friends and faculty are saying that don't go for long term internships now as this is the 3rd year only. And saying that you will get more companies here only. they told that i am going in a wrong way. By listening to those words i got much fear.

Internal Amplifier:
As most of our surrounding people and Faculty are saying that not to go for internship, i thought that they can guid us in a right way. So i can listen to them.
And also i felt that i will miss all the subjects that are in these 2 years, like that.

External Filter: One day our director sir came and talked with us and he gave us lots of support and encouragement to face all those Amplifiers. i have written all pros and cons of this internship and my internal filters dominated all my internal and external Amplifiers.

Actions: 
Constructive Actions: I have taken a Constructive Action that to come here for doing internship. I thought that, if i get good knowledge there then it will be useful to me in my further growth otherwise i will learn the company culture, how it would be in any company. like that i have taken a constructive decision.
In 3rd and 4th year we must do an Internship atleast  for 3 months. Everyone should leave at some point of time, but my turn came first than my friends, like that i encouraged myself and came here.

Result:
Success: After coming here i personally felt so many times that i have chosen good choice and now my friends also realising that i have taken the correct decision. I am able to feel and see my progress in many aspects.



Case Study-2: During Lockdown, Feeling Homesick.

Disappointment: we came to the campus on jan 19 after pongal holidays. basically, we will have holidays after every 3 months because we will go to our college for writing our semester holidays. At that time after the completion of our exams we will go to our homes and we will back after 1 week. we all have started our projects and completed and the next day we will go to our college. So, mentally i have prepared my mind before 10 days that i am going to my college as well as to my home after completing the exams. But, suddenly lockdown came and we are unable to go home. At that time i got disappointed. 

Emotions: for every 3 days on evening breaks, i will make a video call to my home and spent with them. Whenever my mother and my sister ask me that to come to home, i got emotionally disturbed. sometimes, my mother will cry if she saw me on video call. If i saw the tears from my mom eyes, i won't face my mother. But always my mother thinks in all possible ways and she can understand the situations.



Intensity: At first i felt homesick but my external and internal filters motivated me to stay here.
External Filter:
My mother and father are the best motivators and best guides to me in all situations, whenever i got emotional they will explain me the situation and support me. Whenever i told to them that i can't come to home until 6 months they said ok. and they understood all the things. And they suggested me, to stay here only as the situations are not good. And there will be some days which can make us emotional, so we need to be strong like that they will encourage me.

Internal Filter:
I am having a good habit and i really felt happy for having that habit in me. that is i can understand the situations and i can control myself in any situation. In every situation i will see the pros and cons of that and then only i will take decision, i think that it is not a bad habit, because i want to be practical in my life. when sir said that the people who are in campus can't go to home now, at that time i am already expected that from sir because i know the situations and i have taken it simple. Instead of feeling emotional, i encourage my self, that i am going to learn more things than the others. And this is the time to become equal to my friends in learning. And i decided to use this period more productively. 



Actions:
Constructive Actions: I have taken constructions by following all the instructions given by sir during lockdown. I have improved my immunity power by doing yoga daily. I am constantly placing my efforts to learn and i have learnt so many things like mopping,time management. And i have used the lockdown period in a productive way.

Result:
Success:
I really thankful to god, because everytime he saves me. I didn't go home during lockdown. because of that, i have taken my constructive actions, i gained the knowledge and i am revising and building the websites by learning new concepts. So, it is a great success to me in this lockdown also. Because of sir sessions regarding developing the growth mindset in me, i am taking proper constructive actions, and feeling that growth in me.



Case Study-3: While writing the exams

Disappointment: Whenever there is any exam, if i got less marks then i will get disappointed. At that time i will compare my marks with others everytime and i felt very bad for that. This habit makes me to loss my self confidence and makes me to get disappointed.

Emotions:
sometimes, i was emotionally disturbed by comparing my marks with my close friends.And i will stay away from my friends for sometime.

Intensity: I have taken this in a negative way and i build my own perceptions that i can't do this like them.
External Filters:
One day in sir session, sir explained us about the term "Value" and how to create the "Value". This is my first external Filter that i came across. On that day, i realised that Creating value is more important than getting a job. If we create Good Value to us then there is no need to concentrate on marks or money, because those are the outcomes of that value. After listening to that meeting, i started thinking about creating a value instead of bothering about my marks on exams.

Internal Amplifiers:
I thought that if i get less marks in exams, the friends and people around me will see me as a failure.Because of this negative feeling i have concentrated more on marks than knowledge.

Actions:
Constructive Actions: After listening to the sir meeting regarding creating a value, I have decided to create a value to me. I have started to gain knowledge only. After that Whenever there is exam i will talk with myself not to concentrate on marks and try to solve the problem only. I have taken this as my checklist. And i started following this action item.

Result:
Success:
I really got success because of following those things given by sir. One day i have concentrated only on solving the problem not on marks, after that i really got good marks. For that i felt very happy and i am still believing that if we are able to create our Value then we can survive any where without any doubt.

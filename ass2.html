					MY OBSERVATIONS


The reason for not developing are:
	these are the things which i came across in the begining days


1. Not taking learning hours as serious is one of the reason for not developing.
2. whenever there is 2 tasks, at that time Not able to prioritise the tasks.
3. Not listening to the class properly,because of thinking about family or because of health problems and not having interest at that time etc.
4. Resistance is the main reason that i came across in those first few months while i came here. whenever i get any doubt, i didn't ask anyone because of resistance and i will left that topic. If there is exam regarding that topic at that time i felt very fear and after taking too much time, i will break my resistance and then only i will go and ask my friends. 
5. Emotional behaviour, if i talk with my parents before coming to the session and if they say their feelings on me and if they ask me to come to home once, i can't control myself, and after coming to the session also i will be thinking of my family instead of listening to the class.
6. comparing with the others, this is the most common thing that we learnt in our college, comparing with others and getting disappointed. Basically, i am a slow learner in the sense i will take more time than others while learning, but once i have learnt i will be good in that. while doing the assignments, if my friends are completing their assignments faster than me, i will felt very sad and i will stop doing and i will get into deep thoughts like why i am not doing like them though i am from CSE, like that i will think and i will discourage myself that i can't do these assignments fast like them.
7. The 2 main reasons that i need to mention is, if i have any doubt i will never ask my friends because i felt that if i ask any doubt they will see me in as a failure like that i used to feel. And i thought that, if i ask our Guid who is taking the sessions they will feel that she is slow learner. because of these 2 reasons in the initial days i have struggled a lot.
8. sometimes not able to concentrate on the class by thinking about the future and the promises that we made to our family. for example: The motivation to me is my family and my village only. while i was a small kid i am continuously watching or facing all the problems that a middle class family should face. so that while i was in my 10 th standard i have promised to my parents that i will do a good job which makes you free from these problems, like that i told to them. so i am thinking that in these days can i finish that promise or not, like this i am thinking.
9. if we get less marks in exam, feeling ourself or discouraging ourself that they are not able to do that.
10. Not concentrating on their knowledge gaps or not able to find where they are missing.
11. spending more time on the things which are unnecessary or which don't need that much time.
12. Addicting more to the mobile or games or any other things which makes our time to be wasted and which makes us not to concentrate on the class.
13. The reason for not developing is not taking proper care on their health because of that not attending to the classes and missing some topics.
14. Developing a negative mindset is also a biggest reason for not developing a person.
15. whenever a situation came suddenly, then instead of knowing about the actual reasons, framing their own perceptions and getting deviated in that mood.
16. Not coming out of our comfort zones.
17. most of the times feeling homesick and thinking about the family in class.
18. if they gave any assignment, instead of doing on our own asking our teammates or friends for the help.
19. if we are having any concern then feeling fear to go and ask the right person and staying like that only and getting deviated by thinking about that thing.   
20. not placing continuous or constant efforts to achieve something or not concentrating on their growth.
21. while giving the instructions not hearing them or else not following the instructions properly.
22. not following the task framework.
23. Not taking the proper action items or not taking the teammates help or guide help if they are not able to place the proper action items.
24. they are not observing themselves or their mistakes and they are not able to observe those things where they need to develop.
25. coming to the class and going to the room only for attendance instead of the having a mindset to learn or not having growth mindset.
26. Not placing any goals and going in a flow. 
27. not following the Execution level programming and getting stuck at a point.
28. Not planning or placing day plan and using the time for unnecessary things.
29. i observed in some brothers and sisters, some of the people are highly deviating because of their parents force regarding job.
30. Sometimes Not taking the given tasks seriously.
31. getting frustrated to the small things and that frustration affecting on learning after coming to the class.
32. not taking proper rest in breaks which affects that in class.
33.  if they don't have the thought of being progressed about their growth.
